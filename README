CSE 451 Autumn '11 Project 3 Undelete

e2undel accepts an Ext2 file system and attempts to recover deleted files. These
are placed in a recoveredFiles directory and named file-nnnn where nnnn is the
original inode number for the recovered file. For more information, see
http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse451/11au/projects/project3.shtml.

Files are only recovered if deemed uncorrupted, ie in cases where only partial
recovery is possible e2undel will not attempt to recover any of the file.
